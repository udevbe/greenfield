The keycodes component of a keyboard mapping specifies the range and
interpretation of the raw keycodes reported by the device. It sets the keycodes
symbolic name, the minimum and maximum legal codes for the keyboard, and the
symbolic name for each key. The keycodes component might also contain aliases
for some keys, symbolic names for some indicators and a description of which
indicators are physically present.

// EXTRAS:
//
// APL Keyboard Layouts

// This file supports:
// -	The Sharp APL for Unix (SAX) layout
// -	The IBM APL2 layout
// -	The Manugistics APL*PLUS II (Version 5.1, 1993) keyboard layout
// -	The Dyalog APL layout - with additions for box drawing and commands

// Unicode APL table: http://aplwiki.com/UnicodeAplTable
// ...and another: http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/h2110611.pdf (appendix A)
// Generic Unicode stuff: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/index.htm

// Tim Nelson (this file's creator) says:

// This file doesn't deal with all the combining stuff -- I'm not an APL programmer,
// and am not quite sure what's needed here.  However, it may be possible to get this
// working with dead keys and the like.  Patches gratefully accepted.  
// [Geoff Streeter: What has been done to is to support all of the APL overstrikes in the compose table]

// Some of the shift-key assignments may differ from the APL tradition.  If
// that's not considered acceptable, it should be possible to remap the 
// shift keys.  I have striven, however, to ensure that the use of shift keys
// in these maps is at least self-consistent.  

// I'm assuming that this will be used with another keyboard layout (ie. for 
// your language), with a special shift key to use these maps.  

// 2018-07-02 added some codes to the Unicode Private Use page.
// 2017-02-27 changed ¤ to ⌺, added ⊆
// 2012-09-26 changed "overbar" to macron which fixed some strangeness in xterm

// 2011-12-22 Geoff Streeter: geoff@dyalog.com
// Added the Dyalog support.
// Corrected (what he thinks) are some errors.
// 	Resolving the confusion between APL's and Unicode's concept of Left and Right tacks.
// 	Unsure about some of the inheritance from APL2 into APLPLUS. Patches welcome.
// Complied with freedesktop.org requirement that the keycodes be in sorted order. Which
// leads to the bottom to top (roughly) definitions.

// default layout seems to have to be the first one. Choosing the basic Dyalog layout is definitely
// better than using the "common" one. Choosing the complete Dyalog layout is not useful to non-Dyalog
// users.

// http://www.nongnu.org/sinhala/doc/keymaps/sinhala-keyboard_3.html

// Repaya, Rakaransaya and Yansaya aren't inserted with A-r, R and Y,
// respectively. The problem lies with the XKB infrastructure which
// only allows a one-to-one mapping of keycodes to Unicode codepoints.
// Unfortunately, the 3 mentioned glyphs actually consists of 3
// Unicode codepoints each. The result is that the user must
// manually construct the glyph by typing each of the 3 codepoints.
// ALT-, represents the 'JOIN' key, it requires
// two codepoints, hence it also has to be manually constructed.
// Similarly, ALT-/ representing the 'TOUCH' key requires
// two codepoints.

// Repaya = rayanna,AL,ZWJ
// Rakaransaya = AL,ZWJ,rayanna
// Yansaya = AL,ZWJ,yayanna
// JOIN = AL,ZWJ
// TOUCH = ZWJ,AL

// Where,
// AL = Al Lakuna = ALT-a
// ZWJ = Zero Width Joiner = ALT-/
// rayanna = r
// yayanna = y

// SINHALA - US, SUBSTITUTES SOME AND ADDS SOME
// =============================================
//
// This started as an upgrade to the first romanized version of
// Sinhala called PTS Pali created in the 1860s. PTS requires
// dots and bars on letters that are rare in fonts, and impossible
// to type. Its singular purpose was to print Tripitaka, the
// collection of Buddhist discourses.
//
// This version covers the entire newer Sinhala phoneme chart
// (Hodiya) that became standard just before the end of the 19th
// century. All the phonemes map to the SBCS. It is easy and
// faster than English to type. It overcomes the setback of
// Unicode Sinhala that it is not compatible with Pali and
// Sanskrit because it encodes two ligatures as base letters and
// the SLS1134 specification matching shape and morpheme sets
// violating Sanskrit orthography.
//
// Most importantly, this romanized version of Sinhala has a
// companion orthographic font that displays the text in the
// native script and a JavaScript converts it to Unicode Sinhala
// and back dramatically increasing Sinhala seen on the web due
// to its ease of use

    //  ‣ The <TLDE> key gets grave ` and asciitilde ~ as on English keyboards.
    //  ‣ In sum the grave and asciitilde are present twice, as their erstwhile places are not removed.
    //  ‣ The braces }{ take the place of the less-than and greater-than >< signs,

// Tibetan Standard Keyboard map for XKB/X.org
//
// Based on the CNS Tibetan keyboard as supported by Windows Vista
// using information published by Tashi Tsering:
// http://www.yalasoo.com/English/docs/yalasoo_en_MStbKb.html
//
// XKB version by Rich Felker <dalias@aerifal.cx>.
//
// The CNS Tibetan keyboard standard specifies 5 keyboards worth of keys,
// but apparently makes no requirements about how each is accessed. Only
// the first 2 are needed for native Tibetan text; the remainder are
// filled with special symbols and letters for transliterating foreign
// text. Further, CNS leaves the level of support of keyboards 2-5 as an
// option to the implementor (despite the fact that #2 is absolutely
// essential...). Windows Vista maps them as follows:
//
// 1. Unshifted
// 2. "m"-key-prefixed
// 3. Shift-modified
// 4. Ctrl+Alt+Shift-modified
// 5. "M"-key-prefixed
//
// I roughly copy the Windows Vista mapping, which was intended by the
// designer of the keyboard, with the following exceptions:
//
// The fifth keyboard is almost empty and contains only precomposed forms
// of subjoined letter characters whose use is strongly discouraged, and
// is not implemented at all in this XKB map. The fourth is implemented,
// but is accessed by an "m"-prefix (or "M"-prefix, for convenience)
// followed by a Shift-modified key. This avoids stealing the Ctrl and Alt
// keys, which belong to applications on *nix and not to the keyboard or
// input method. Aside from enterring rare special symbols and
// foreign-word-transliteration letters, these differences should not
// affect users.
//
// Implementation notes:
//
// A latching ISO Level3 shift is used for the "m"-prefix modifier. In
// principle moving it to other keys (e.g. AltGr) would be possible
// according to user preference, but this is not practical for typing
// Tibetan, since the subjoined consonants, of which Tibetan has 0-2 per
// syllable, are accessed via this mechanism.
//
// One annoyance is that the latching Level3 shift fails to work if the
// previous key is not yet released when "m" is pressed (the key release
// event kills the latch). I consider this a bug in X and don't know an
// easy way to work around it. Complain to the maintainers if it bothers
// you and maybe they'll find a fix. You won't notice it unless you're
// fast at typing Tibetan anyway.

// Tibetan Standard Keyboard with ASCII numerals
//
// Users may prefer that the numeral keys enter ASCII numerals instead of
// Tibetan numerals, since the latter are not in modern use in Tibet.
// This is especially an issue for laptop users who do not have a numeric
// keypad by which to access the ASCII numerals, and who need to type
// numbers to be interpreted by applications.
//
// In this mapping, the Shift-modified numeral keys generate Tibetan
// numerals, since it was unclear to me that the standard Latin punctuation
// keys would be any use without Latin letters. (One can imagine wanting to
// type an email address using the @ sign, but as of present non-ASCII
// email addresses are not possible.) This mapping may change in the future
// if a clearly better use for the shifted numerals is pointed out by users.

// Pinyin Keyboard, in the style of altgr-intl
//
// Chinese speakers and learners often find it hard to type Hanyu Pinyin
// with all its tones and ü. This rule defines an altgr-intl-like behavior,
// with dead keys activated by "AltGr + <key>". It also works with many
// "pinyin" extensions, such as Tongyong Pinyin (Taiwan Mandarin) and
// various SASM/GNC romanizations.
//
// Number row keys 1 2 3 4 are defined as dead-keys for the tones.
// They correspond to the four tones in Hanyu Pinyin.
//
// To generate a · for "neutral" syllables, use AltGr + ` (grave).
// To generate a raw ü, use AltGr + v.
// V is used instead of ü for tones.
//
// AltGr+Shift+` triggers dead_abovering (˚), used by the Taiwanese
// Tongyong Pinyin variant for the "neutral" tone.
//
// AltGr+6 triggers dead_circumflex (^) for ê ẑ ĉ ŝ, etc.
// These can be stacked after tones to produce ế and ề; other tones require
// combining characters, available through nobreakspace (AltGr+Space).
//
// AltGr+Shift+6 triggers dead_diaeresis (¨) for SASM/GNC
// romanization of tib, mon, and ug.
//
// This file should be used with an appropriate XCompose file with
// definitons for dead_{macron,acute,caron,grave} + a/e/i/o/u/v(ü).

//Description           :       This is an adaptation of the Sarala keyboard (http://www.medhajananam.org/sarala/) developed 
//                              by Krishna Dhullipalla. Because of the way keyboard shortcuts are laid out in KDE, the keyboard
//                              modifiers had to be changed. The layout does not take any part of the original Sarala keyboard 
//                              code however. It has been developed from scratch, so the experience may differ.
//			        
//                              There is a ibus-m17n version of Sarala layout developed by Satya Pothamsetti <potham@gmail.com> on 
//                              http://www.medhajananam.org/.
//Standard		:	Supports Unicode 9.0.	 
//Help			:	This layout differs slightly from the layout on Medhajenanam. The layout has been depicted in the 
//				pdf file attached to this post on Sarala google group.

// Name:        KaGaPa phonetic
// Brief:       Devanagari layout (Hindi, Sanskrit, Nepali, Marathi, etc.)
// Diagram:     (Original)[http://baraha.com/help/Keyboards/dev_brhkbd.htm]
//              (This layout)[http://bdsatish.in/lang/dev-kagapa.png]
//
// Description: Based on KaGaPa layout (also called Baraha layout or Nudi layout)
//              which is a modified layout of the specification by Dr. K. P. Rao.
//              This is a phonetic layout with the following features:
//              [1] All letters are mapped to phonetically-similar English keys
//                  as much as possible.
//              [2] The independent vowel (svara) and its dependent vowel (maatra)
//                  use the same key (depending upon SHIFT, ALTGR or ALTGR + SHIFT).
//              [3] Consonant conjuncts are produced by explicitly invoking the
//                  'viraama' (key f). The 'short a' maatra is implicit in all
//                  consonants.
//              [4] Zero width non-joiner and joiner are on keys 6 and 7
//                  respectively. These are absolutely essential for alternative
//                  glyph renderings of consonant half-forms.
//              [5] Rigvedic accent marks, visarga variants.

// Support for Irish (old and new orthography) and English
// Seamus O Ciardhuain <seoc@cnds.ucd.ie>  (19 December 2002)

// The general idea is to provide the characters in ISO 8859-1,
// ISO 8859-15, ISO 8859-14, CP1252 and "Extended Latin-8".
// However, not all are accessible directly because there aren't
// enough keys; some need deadkeys to access them, others the 
// "Multi_key" compose sequences.

// Designed to be similar to the layouts used on Windows
// and the Macintosh.

// Everything is in Group 1 to be compatible with the
// multi-layout keyboard support in XFree86 4.3.

// The basic layout is a modern keyboard, but dotted consonants are
// accessible using a deadkey (AltGr+H or AltGr+W).
// If a proper Clo Gaelach keyboard is needed, then use the layout
// defined below as ie(CloGaelach), which gives dotted consonants
// without use of a deadkey.

// Version 2.0

// The following variants are defined in this file:

// "bds" - the BDS keyboard layout compliant with the proposed
//         Bulgarian state standard BDS 5237:2006

// "phonetic" - the phonetic Bulgarian layout with the traditional position
//              of the letters

// "bas_phonetic" - the phonetic keyboard layout compliant with the
//                  proposed Bulgarian state standard BDS 5237:2006

// "latin" - an extended variant of the QWERTY layout with symbols that
//           Bulgarian users will type while the keyboard is in Latin mode

// The reasons behind the layout of the symbols in levels 3 and 4 are
// explained in http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0484  (in Bulgarian).

// Two notes for the maintainers of xkeyboard-config:

// 1. Please do not use key names such as <LatQ> for the Bulgarian
// phonetic layouts.  The placement of the symbols must stay always
// the same regardless of which one of the alias sets in
// xkb/keycodes/aliases is used.

// 2. The layouts should not include level3(ralt_switch).

// The 'Biblical Hebrew' keyboard layout as defined by Tiro for use with the
// 'SBL Hebrew' font was added 2006.11.13 by Sebastian J. Bronner
// <waschtl@sbronner.com>.  Its primary features (as compared to the lyx layout)
// are that the consonants are in the Israeli standard positions, that a great
// multitude of glyphs can be input directly from the keyboard, and that it is
// the closest thing to a standard layout a theologian can hope for.
// Documentation (including printable keyboard tables), SBL Hebrew font, and
// keyboard layout for Windows are available at
// http://www.sbl-site.org/Resources/Resources_BiblicalFonts.aspx.
//
// It is of interest that the 'basic' layout defined first in this file (as
// ships with x.org disagrees in the non-consonant characters that the Tiro-
// layout claims to be the Israeli standard.  Tiros apparent diligence in the
// PDF-documentation accompanying the keyboard-layout-files lead me to put
// greater stock in their claim than in this file.  Therefore, the 'biblical'
// layout below does not include 'il(basic)' but redoes the _whole_ thing from
// scratch.

// EXTRAS

// Biblical hebrew (SIL) US Standard layout version 1.5
// This map is based closely on v 1.5 of the standard. The only deviation being the replacement of the composite characters sin and shin 
// by their more recent Unicodev6 counterparts
// this map contains all the characters found in Biblical annotation, masoretic and Dead Sea Scroll related work.
// The layout corresponds phonetically to a US standard layout or similar (Qwerty).
// If you are using an actual Hebrew keyboard, you are probably better off using a Tiro compliant scholarly layout

// eng: Russian-based polyglot and reactionary keyboard layout
// This keyboard layout covers Russian in Petrine 1708 and Bolshevik 1918 variant spelling, Ukrainian, Belorussian, Serbian in its modern and Slavenoserbian variants, and Bulgarian and Slavomacedonian in pre-1945 and post-1945 spelling,
// in short all in any dominion prevailing Cyrillic orthographies of modern secular Slavic literary languages, even with dictionary accentuation marks,
// but also the most-widespread Church Slavonic spellings, that is all Church-Slavonic in so far as variants can be replaced without loss of meaning  – not to speak of Interslavic.
// Furthermore, it suffices Romanian Cyrillic, Moldovan Cyrillic, Abkhazian excluding the more clumsy obsoleted forms unlikely to find devotees, Tajik, all Turkic and Mongolic Cyrillic alphabets
// and virtually all overlooked languages in Cyrillic reigns at least by combining characters, taking advantage of eight key levels.
// This is withal a pan-Cyrillic keyboard layout, or a comprehensive Cyrillic keyboard layout, an universal Cyrillic keyboard layout, a generic Cyrillic keyboard layout.

// The different local languages in Togo uses all together 17 symbols not found in French language:
// Ʒ, ɛ, Ɗ, Ƴ, Ʊ, Ɩ, Ɔ, Ǝ, Ɖ, Ƒ, Ɣ, Ĥ, Ɨ, Ɲ, Ʋ, Ɓ, Ŋ.
// Togolese local languages use 9 tone markers:
// Acute ( ´ ),	Grave ( ` ), Circumflex ( ˆ ), Caron ( ˇ ), Macron ( ¯ ), Tilde ( ~ ), Tilde + Acute (  ̃́ ), Tilde + Grave (  ̃̀ ), Diaeresis ( ¨ )
// The vowels can use these tone markers except diaeresis.
// 'Y' is not used as a vowel in most local languages, and can only use diaeresis.
// Nasal consonants (m, n, ŋ) can only have have accent tones (acute and grave)

// to intuit the corresponding X names.	 Lacking proper documentation,
// I may have made some mistakes.

// Entries marked MISSING mark Mac characters for which I was unable
// to find a corresponding keysym.  (Some for sure don't: e.g. the
// Apple mark and the oe/OE character; others I may have simply not

// Dead-keys definition for a very simple US/ASCII layout.
// by Conectiva (http://www.conectiva.com.br)
// modified by Ricardo Y. Igarashi (iga@that.com.br)

// Added the following deadkeys, to make it truly international:
//
// dead_macron: on AltGr-minus
// dead_breve: on AltGr-parenleft
// dead_abovedot: on AltGr-period
// dead_abovering: on AltGr-0
// dead_doubleacute: on AltGr-equal (as quotedbl is already used)
// dead_caron: on AltGr-less (AltGr-shift-comma)
// dead_cedilla: on AltGr-comma
// dead_ogonek: on AltGr-semicolon
// dead_belowdot: on AltGr-underscore (AltGr-shift-minus)
// dead_hook: on AltGr-question
// dead_horn: on AltGr-plus (AltGr-shift-equal)
// dead_diaeresis: on AltGr-colon (Alt-shift-semicolon)
//
// those were already there:
// dead_grave
// dead_acute
// dead_circumflex
// dead_tilde
// dead_diaeresis

//
// This file works just like a regular keyboard, BUT has all dead-keys

// followed by an e. In other words, this keyboard is not international as long

//
// The original MS International keyboard was intended for Latin1 (iso8859-1).
// With the introduction of iso8859-15, the (important) ligature oe (and OE)
// became available. I added them next to ae. Because I write ediaeresis more
// often than registered, I moved registered to be next to copyright and added

// the advantage of avoiding hidden states --- each keypress changes
// something on screen.

// The <KPDL> key is a mess.

// by making "." an accepted alternative, but standards still use "," as
// default)
// As a result users of SI-abiding countries expect either a "." or a ","
// or a "decimal_separator" which may or may not be translated in one of the
// above depending on applications.
// It's not possible to define a default per-country since user expectations
// depend on the conflicting choices of their most-used applications,
// operating system, etc. Therefore it needs to be a configuration setting

// Russian Polish-phonetic Dvorak
// by Adrian Dziubek <adrian.dziubek@gmail.com>
//
// This layout aims to enable Polish Dvorak users to type with Russian
// Cyrillic alphabet by using the sound correspondence between Polish and
// Russian languages.
//
// This keyboard should be intuitive. Please let me know, if my intuition
// lets You down.
//
// The guidelines used:
// - no Cyrillic symbols are placed on punctuation symbols,
// - visual similarities are ignored if there is a sound correspondence:
//   no Cyrillic_es on c, no Cyrillic_er on p, no Cyrillic_ha on x etc.,
// - the Latin symbols that have close sound correspondence (as read in Polish)
//   to Cyrillic symbols (as read in Russian) are mapped respectively:
//         * j -> Cyrillic_shorti,
//         * k -> Cyrillic_ka,
//         * b -> Cyrillic_be,
//         * m -> Cyrillic_em,
//         * w -> Cyrillic_ve,
//         * z -> Cyrillic_ze
//         * a -> Cyrillic_a,
//         * o -> Cyrillic_o,
//         * u -> Cyrillic_u,
//         * i -> Cyrillic_i,
//         * d -> Cyrillic_de,
//         * h -> Cyrillic_ha,
//         * t -> Cyrillic_te,
//         * n -> Cyrillic_en,
//         * s -> Cyrillic_es,
//         * p -> Cyrillic_pe,
//         * y -> Cyrillic_yeru,
//         * f -> Cyrillic_ef,
//         * g -> Cyrillic_ghe,
//         * c -> Cyrillic_tse,
//         * r -> Cyrillic_er,
//         * l -> Cyrillic_el,
// - ...and little more distant:
//         * AltGr + s (sacute) -> Cyrillic_sha,
//         * AltGr + z (zabovedot) -> Cyrillic_zhe,
//         * AltGr + c (cacute) -> Cyrillic_che,
// - the soft versions of Russian vowels are accessible through AltGr + vowel:
//         * AltGr + a -> Cyrillic_ya,
//         * AltGr + o -> Cyrillic_io,
//         * AltGr + u -> Cyrillic_yu,
// - ...except for Cyrillic_ie which is more frequently used than Cyrillic_e:
//         * AltGr + e -> Cyrillic_e,
//         * e -> Cyrillic_ie,
// - q is also mapped to Cyrillic_ya, following the US phonetic keyboard
//   choice, as Cyrillic_ya and Cyrillic_a are both often used:
//         * q -> Cyrillic_ya,
// - the soft and hard symbols that have no Polish counterparts are mapped
//   to rarely used in Polish x character:
//         * x -> Cyrillic_softsign
//         * AltGr + x -> Cyrillic_hardsign,
// - the soft sign is additionally available as AltGr + consonant combination
//   for every consonant that can be softened or separated by soft sign:
//         * AltGr + l -> Cyrillic_softsign,
//         * AltGr + d -> Cyrillic_softsign,
//         * AltGr + n -> Cyrillic_softsign,
//         * AltGr + r -> Cyrillic_softsign,
//         * AltGr + t -> Cyrillic_softsign,
//         * AltGr + p -> Cyrillic_softsign,
// - ...and also because of visual similarity under level3 b:
//         * AltGr + b -> Cyrillic_softsign,
//         * Shift + AltGr + b -> Cyrillic_hardsign,
// - the Cyrillic_shcha symbol is placed under AltGr + w (visual similarity):
//         * AltGr + w -> Cyrillic_shcha
// - v, also rarely unused in Polish is mapped like w:
//         * v -> Cyrillic_ve,

//
// = HISTORY
// * 2004-09-28:
//   Initial cleanroom writing of the keymap, I just booted Mac OS X, opened
//   TextEdit.app and wrote down what the value produced by each key was when I
//   pressed it, a for a, A for shift + a, å for lalt + a etc and made the
//   keymap from that information
//
// * 2006-01-14:
//   Revised the comments in the file
//
// * 2013-05-30:
//   Renamed the old keyboard layout and created a new one that conforms with the later
//   model Apple laptop and Aluminium USB/Bluetooth keyboards (A1243/A1255 and later)
//   that are used with the more recent versions of OS X. Also replaced some Unicode
//   codes with proper symbol names.
//
// = NOTES
// * 20 characters in this keymap have no named character defined in
//   include/keysymdef.h and as a result their Unicode code points in
//   hexadecimal are listed here, these can be generated with the following
//   perl command:
//     $ perl -CA -e 'printf "U%x\n", ord shift' Æ
//   and converted back like:
//     $ perl -CO -le '$_=shift;s/[^a-f0-9]//ig;print chr hex' Uc6
// * The Apple logo appears twice on this keymap like the Mac OS and Mac OS X
//   keymaps. In the MacRoman encoding it has the code point 0xF0 (240) but it
//   has no assigned code point in Unicode, the code point Apple uses for it is
//   U+F8FF (63743) which is in the BMP's Private Use Area (U+E000–U+F8FF)
// * This keymap has only been tested on a PowerBook6,5 (iBook G4) but it
//   should work on other Apple laptop models which use the same keyboard
//   layout. It will probably work on standard sized keyboards with little or
//   no modification but it might not support them fully, please report if
//   you're able to get it running with such a keyboard

// nationalizing the layout as e.g. the Norwegian, Swedish and French
// layouts which modify the primary keys of the basic Dvorak layout
// extensively.

// Rather it's a simple modification of 5 keys of the US Dvorak layout,
// it adds Germanic/Icelandic style quotation marks („“), eth (ðÐ), ae
// (æÆ), endash and emdash (–—), thorn (þÞ), EuroSign (€) and the German
// Sharp S (ßẞ). These keys aren't used in the US version, making the
// Icelandic version a superset of it.

// Maybe someone else will make a "full" attempt at an Icelandic layout
// but I was mostly interested in continuing to type English comfortably
// as a primary function while being able to type the full Icelandic
// alphabet as a secondary function.

//
// Jun 2, 2003. Mashrab Kuvatov <kmashrab@uni-bremen.de>
//
// Created based on the Russian standard keyboard. AEN <aen@logic.ru>
// The following symbols of the Russian standard keyboard were replaced:
// minus (key <AE11>) with Byelorussian_shortu (U045e),
// equal (key <AE12>) with Cyrillic_ka_descender (U049b),
// Cyrillic_ha (key <AD11>) with Cyrillic_ghe_bar (U0493),
// Cyrillic_hardsign (key <AD12>) with Cyrillic_ha_descender (U04b3).
// The following symbols of the Russian standard keyboard were moved:
// Cyrillic_ze       to key <AC02> (English 's'),
// Cyrillic_sha      to key <AD08> (English 'i'),
// Cyrillic_ha       to key <AD09> (English 'o'),
// Cyrillic_hardsign to key <AD10> (English 'p').
//
// Feb 25, 2007. Mashrab Kuvatov <kmashrab@uni-bremen.de>
//
// Made cyrillic and latin variants. Default is cyrillic.
// Cyrillic variant is standard compliant. The standard
// was accepted by the official body of Uzbekistan. See
// http://www.uznet.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=288&Itemid=58
//
// Latin variant is somewhat experimental, since there is no
// official standard for it. It is a copy of "us" layout, where
// apostrophe is replaced with U02BB.

// ========== Cameroon Keyboards ==========


// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This comment was added by <fotang at mmuock dot org>, on 18-Jun-2016:
//  
// All comments below this one, were in the original cm file;they do not
// apply to the Mmuock keyboard which is defined towards the end of this file.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ****** For Instructions, see "Use of Cameroon Keyboards" section	below ******


// The XKB versions of these keyboards were developed by Matthew Lee, Jenni Beadle, and Bruce Cox of SIL Cameroon in association with Going Komputya, Uwe Yung of the Goethe Institute, Yaoundé, and Centre ANACLAC.  

// Cameroon is officially a bilingual country, using French and English, but there are over 270 minority languages.  

// * Cameroon Français is an exact copy of the French France keyboard intended for AZERTY users.
// * Cameroon is an exact copy of the Basic US Keyboard. I can not currently name this "Cameroon English" due to a limitation of XKB.
// * Cameroon QWERTY and Cameroon AZERTY are based largely on SIL Cameroon's Keyman and Microsoft keyboards of the same style already in wide use.  These keyboards are designed to allow the user to type any of Cameroon's 270+ languages and dialects that use the approved orthography.  This Approved Orthography was adopted in 1979 by the National Committee for the Unification and Harmonisation of Alphabets of Camerooninan Languages. 
// * Cameroon Dvorak is described below.

// ===== Use of Cameroon Keyboards =====

// == Fonts ==
// These keyboards are fully Unicode (5.1), so we recommend using a good unicode font for diacritics to position correctly. Recommended fonts are: ttf-sil-charis, ttf-sil-doulos, ttf-sil-gentium and ttf-sil-andika (All of which are free for Linux, Mac, and Windows).


// == Cameroon AZERTY ==
// Cameroon AZERTY uses the French France (AZERTY) layout, as french keyboards are widely used here. While this keyboard is designed for Cameroonian orthography, it still is possible but not recommended, to type French with minimal discomfort using this keyboard.
// Cameroon AZERTY uses the "!" (exclamation) key as the "Cameroon" key. Pressing this key before another key allows you to access the special letters and diacritics needed in Cameroonian orthography.
// For example, press "!" then "a" and get "ɛ" (small epsilon). "!" then "Shift" + "a" (A) will get an "Ɛ" (capital epsilon). Press the "!" key twice to get a "!".
// If you prefer, you can hold the AltGr (and/or Shift) key to access the same letters, but we have found this to be much more awkward in practice. If you really don't like our Cameroon key, simply comment out "include "cm(exclamation_switch)"" and the exclamation key will return to normal.
// All Diacritics (with the exception of French Trema and Circumflex) must be typed (in order of stacking) after the letter.


// == Cameroon QWERTY ==
// Cameroon QWERTY uses the US QWERTY layout, as US keyboards are also widely used here. While this keyboard is designed for Cameroonian orthography, it is possible, but not recommended, to type English with minimal discomfort using this keyboard.
// Cameroon QWERTY uses the ";" (semicolon) key as the "Cameroon" key.	Pressing this key before another key allows you to access the special letters and diacritics needed in Cameroonian orthography.
// For example, press ";" then "a" and get "ɛ" (small epsilon). ";" then "Shift" + "a" (A) will get an "Ɛ" (capital epsilon). Press ";" twice to get a ";", or press Shift + ; (:) twice to get a ":" (colon).
// If you prefer, you can hold the AltGr (and/or Shift) key to access the same letters, but we have found this to be much more awkward in practice. If you really don't like our Cameroon key, simply comment out "include "cm(semicolon_switch)"" and the semicolon key will return to normal.
// All Diacritics must be typed (in order of stacking) after the letter.


// == Cameroon Dvorak ==
// Cameroon Dvorak is uses a similar system to Cameroon QWERTY.

// ------- begin Mmuock alphabet layout ------------------------------------------
//   This layout is used for the Mmuock alphabet as described in the book
//   _The Sound of Mmuock: Orthography (2. ed.)_ [isbn: 978-9956-645-28-1].
//   Mmuock is the language of the Mmuock (local: Muòk) people of Western
//   Cameroon.  
// 
//      Author: Tano Fotang <fotang at mmuock dot org>
//     Created: 2014-06-24
//     Version: 1.2
//
// CHANGES v 1.0:
//	2014-07-06 corrected shifted level3 of <AC11> to quotedbl
// CHANGES v 1.1:
//  2015-05-23 1- added dead_tilde to key <TILDE>; this is needed to produce
//               the letter <ñ> which was totally missing from the keyboard
//             2- added letter <dz> to <AB01>; the letter had been missing.
//             3- if we're not re-defining particular symbols from the included
//               latin layout, then maintain the original latin mappings.
//               Previously, we had set them to NoSymbol. Now, we want to
//               keep the original latin mappings except for those few that we
//               want to overwrite for our own keyboard.
//
// CHANGES v 1.2:
// 2016-06-17  1- added dead keys dead_macron, dead_acute, and dead_grave for
//                tones 1, 3, and 4, for compatibility with the Keyman version.
//             2- rearranged combining diacritics for tones 0 to 5 such that
//                the diacritics are on consequetive keys (AC01 to AC05).
//             3- moved tone 8 to level 3 of AE12.
//             4- moved layout definition out of the EXTRAS section.
//             5- for a cleaner keyboard,
//                replaced ṭhe included latin layout with us(basic).
//
//
// NOTES:
// 0. This map is based on the Latin alphabet layout for the US keyboard.
//
// 1. We use combining diacritical marks to create tone markings. There are 13
//    tones that need to be indicated, although the first 5 are usually enough
//    to represent the rest in simplified orthography.
//
// 2. When composing Mmuock text, about every fourth symbol is for tone. To
//    facilitate easy and fast input, the combining diacritics are placed on
//    the home row (AC). To reduce the number of key strokes required, the
//    unshifted third level is used. Only 5 of the combining diacritics are not
//    on the AC row; they are in the top number row, AE.
//
// 3. Symbols that are used infrequently (`r', `h', `ɛ', `ǝ', etc.) are placed
//    in level3. Additionally, the letter eng (`ŋ'), although commonly used, 
//    is found in level3 because it can alternatively be represented by <ng>.
//    (Indeed, the keyman version of keyboard actually replaces <ng> with `ŋ'.)
//
// 4. The unshifted AB10 key (normally assigned to the slash `/') is used as
//    level 3 switch since the slash is not used in the ordinary course of
//    typing Mmuock text. 
//
// 5. The 'Cameroon Multilingual' keyboards that are defined elsewhere, do not
//    fit our needs because: (a) they are based on a different alphabet, (b) the
//    vast majority of their symbols are not used in Mmuock, and (c) for the few
//    symbols that are used in Mmuock, their placings are not egonomic for 
//    typing Mmuock as the _PRIMARY_ language. The aim of this keyboard, is
//    to give priority to symbols that are actually used in the Mmuock alphabet.
//
// 6. The following fonts have been found to produce the best results with this
//    keyboard:
//         Family                    Accuracy
//      DejaVu (except Sans Mono)        9/10 
//      Linux Libertine                  8/10
//      Ubuntu (except light)            8/10
//      Droid (except sans mono)         7/10
//      Gentium, Gentium Alt           6.5/10
//    In the terminal emulator, the following font variants have been tested:
//      Ubuntu Mono                      9/10
//      Unifont (Medium)                 9/10
//      DejaVu Sans Mono               7.5/10
//      Droid Sans Mono                6.5/10
//   These fonts are all freely available.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This map is an almost-complete mapping of the standard French
// MacIntosh keyboard under Xwindows.  I tried to remain as faithful
// as possible to the Mac meaning of each key.	I did this entirely by
// hand and by intuition, relying on the Clavier (Keyboard?) Desktop
// Accessory for the Mac meaning of keys, and on reading keysymdef.h
// to intuit the corresponding X names.	 Lacking proper documentation,
// I may have made some mistakes.

// Entries marked CHECK are particularly uncertain

// Entries marked MISSING mark Mac characters for which I was unable
// to find a corresponding keysym.  (Some for sure don't: e.g. the
// Apple mark and the oe/OE character; others I may have simply not
// found.)

//
// = HISTORY
// * 2004-09-28:
//   Initial cleanroom writing of the keymap, I just booted Mac OS X, opened
//   TextEdit.app and wrote down what the value produced by each key was when I
//   pressed it, a for a, A for shift + a, å for lalt + a etc and made the
//   keymap from that information
//
// * 2006-01-14:
//   Revised the comments in the file
//
// = NOTES
// * 20 characters in this keymap have no named character defined in
//   include/keysymdef.h and as a result their Unicode code points in
//   hexadecimal are listed here, these can be generated with the following
//   perl command:
//     $ perl -CA -e 'printf "U%x\n", ord shift' Æ
//   and converted back like:
//     $ perl -CO -le '$_=shift;s/[^a-f0-9]//ig;print chr hex' Uc6
// * The Apple logo appears twice on this keymap like the Mac OS and Mac OS X
//   keymaps. In the MacRoman encoding it has the code point 0xF0 (240) but it
//   has no assigned code point in Unicode, the code point Apple uses for it is
//   U+F8FF (63743) which is in the BMP's Private Use Area (U+E000–U+F8FF)
// * This keymap has only been tested on a PowerBook6,5 (iBook G4) but it
//   should work on other Apple laptop models which use the same keyboard
//   layout. It will probably work on standard sized keyboards with little or
//   no modification but it might not support them fully, please report if
//   you're able to get it running with such a keyboard

    //  - settings may be done from terminal only (GUI does not and won't support it)

    //    otherwise it's not possible to access levels 5-8
    //  - Ctrl+Space related problems:
    //     - If eight-level layout is used as first layout one of eight-level layouts has to
    //       be also chosen in GUI - otherwise the Ctrl+Space "switch" is disabled
    //     - Ctrl+Space has no effect if only four-level layouts are chosen
    //       (don't forget the layout configured in GUI - despite of it's not reachable)
    //     - a few keys in 2nd layer could be mixed with other layouts when Ctrl+Space is "turned on" (why?)
    //       in case eight- and four-level layouts are configured simultaneously
    //     - Ctrl+Space is "turned on" by default and has to be "turned off" for four-level layouts
    //       in case eight- and four-level layouts are configured simultaneously
    //     - four-level layout on first place does not work at all when Ctrl+Space is "turned on"
    //       in case the 2nd, 3rd or 4th layout is eight-level layout

// Instructions
//
// 1. Set basic layout by:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout cz
//
// 2. Set variant by:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout cz -variant qwerty
//    In practice this is equivalent to:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout cz_qwerty
//    However, the latter form isn't portable so always use the -variant option.
//
// 3. Set multilayout by:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout "us,cz" -variant ",qwerty" -option grp:ctrl_shift_toggle
//    This sets the basic us layout active. You can switch to qwerty
//    variant of cz layout by pressing ctrl+shift.
//
// Pitfalls
//
// 1. Many to one mappings
//
// Higher level input method components don't necessarily handle many to
// one mappings correctly. They may assume that there exists only a one
// to one mapping between a hardware key and a symbol. Therefore you
// should take care not to introduce many to one mappings for keys that
// are going to be reverse mapped from a symbol to a hardware key.
//
// Currently at least the modifier keys are affected. Clients may set
// states, such as autorepeat, for hardware keys by reverse mapping a
// modifier symbol to a hardware key and then setting the state for the
// first hardware key that maps to the symbol. The correct way would be
// to modify the state of all hardware keys mapping to a given symbol.
//
// We are nice and keep the mappings one to one for clients that don't
// choose to handle many to one mappings.

The core protocol interpretation of keyboard modifiers does not include direct
support for multiple keyboard groups, so XKB reports the effective keyboard
group to XKB-aware clients using some of the reserved bits in the state field
of some core protocol events. This modified state field would not be interpreted
correctly by XKB-unaware clients, so XKB provides a group compatibility mapping
which remaps the keyboard group into a core modifier mask that has similar
effects, when possible.

XKB maintains three compatibility state components that are used to make
XKB-unaware clients(*) work as well as possible:
- The compatibility state which corresponds to the effective modifier and
  effective group state.
- The compatibility lookup state which is the core-protocol equivalent of the
  lookup state.
- The compatibility grab state which is the nearest core-protocol equivalent
  of the grab state.

Compatibility states are essentially the corresponding XKB states, but with
the keyboard group possibly encoded as one or more modifiers.

Modifiers that correspond to each keyboard group are described in this
group compatibility map.


----
(*) The implementation of XKB invisibly extends the X library to use the
keyboard extension if it is present. That means, clients that use library or
toolkit routines to interpret keyboard events automatically use all of XKB's
features; clients that directly interpret the state field of core-protocol
events or the keymap directly may be affected by some of the XKB differences.

// The capital form of ssharp (called sharp s) only exists for completely
// capitalized text, not for words at the beginning of sentences nor for
// nouns (nouns in German normally start with a captial letter).
// The ssharp key, to the right of the zero key, takes this into account
// and has a questionmark mapped to Shift-ssharp since normally no capital
// version is needed.
// When typing with active CapsLock, this key type is needed to
// output two capital letters S because this is the only German key
// whose capital letter is not the same as the one typed with Shift.

The geometry component of a keyboard mapping specifies primarily the geometry of
the keyboard. It contains the geometry symbolic name and the keyboard geometry
description. The geometry component might also contain aliases for some keys or
symbolic names for some indicators and might affect the set of indicators that
are physically present. Key aliases defined in the geometry component of a
keyboard mapping override those defined in the keycodes component.

// modified from /usr/share/X11/xkb/geometry/pc(pc104)
//
// The Apex 300 (Apex RAW) has 21 additional keys and
// <RWIN> is replaced by a hardware <FN> key.  These
// additions to the basic PC104 layout are shown in red.
//
// Currently the kernel doesn't initialize these keys; a userspace
// tool is needed (apexctl: https://github.com/tuxmark5/ApexCtl).
// With this tool or a proper driver, the extra keys (except FN)
// can be assigned keycodes via udev-hwdb.
//
// FIXME: Keycodes shown here should be changed to match
//        kernel defaults when a driver is developed.
//
// The additional keys are in 4 groups:
// 1)  L1-L2 left of Escape (column)         <I156>,<I157>
// 2)  M1-M12 above F1-F12 (row)             <FK13>-<FK24>
// 3)  MX1-MX5 left of alpha keys (column)   <I171>-<I175>
// 4)  LeftUp, RightUp with regular arrows   <I160>,<I159>
//
// Known <FN> key functions:
// <FN>+<F5> = kbd backlight step dimmer (NoSymbol)
// <FN>+<F6> = kbd backlight step brighter (NoSymbol)
// <FN>+<F7> = <I173> (AudioPrev)
// <FN>+<F8> = <I172> (AudioPlay, AudioPause)
// <FN>+<F9> = <I171> (AudioNext)
// <FN>+<F10> = <MUTE> (AudioMute)
// <FN>+<F10> = <VOL+> (VolumeUp)
// <FN>+<F11> = <VOL-> (VolumeDown)
//
// And yes, the spacebar really is that ridiculous.
