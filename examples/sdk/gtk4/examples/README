== Building the examples ==

The examples in this directory are built alongside the rest of GTK.

The examples under the `application[1-9]` directories are also included in
the GTK API reference documentation, and can be built independently, using
the system libraries, by doing:

    $ cd application1
    $ make -f Makefile.example

== Running the examples ==

The examples can be run uninstalled.

The later demos are using GSettings,so they need a GSettings schema.
The code for these demos contains a workaround to look for the schema
in the current directory, so this works:

    $ cd application5
    & ./exampleapp window.ui
