/* This macro may not do what you expect.  Weston doesn't guarantee
 * a stable API between 1.X and 1.Y, and thus this macro will return
 * FALSE on any WESTON_VERSION_AT_LEAST(1,X,0) if the actual version
 * is 1.Y.0 and X != Y).  In particular, it fails if X < Y, that is,
 * 1.3.0 is considered to not be "at least" 1.4.0.
 *
 * If you want to test for the version number being 1.3.0 or above or
 * maybe in a range (eg 1.2.0 to 1.4.0), just use the WESTON_VERSION_*
 * defines above directly.
