/**
 *
 *            The wldata_device_manager is a singleton global object that
 *            provides access to inter-client data transfer mechanisms such as
 *            copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop.  These mechanisms are tied to
 *            a wlseat and this interface lets a client get a wldata_device
 *            corresponding to a wlseat.
 *
 *            Depending on the version bound, the objects created from the bound
 *            wldata_device_manager object will have different requirements for
 *            functioning properly. See wldata_source.set_actions,
 *            wldata_offer.accept and wldata_offer.finish for details.
